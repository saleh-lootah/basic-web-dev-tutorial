    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>This example is about links and <a href="images.html">images</a></p>

    <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>

    <ul>
      <!--It’s possible to use absolute links to refer to pages in your own website, but hard-coding your domain name everywhere can make for some tricky situations. It’s usually a better idea to reserve absolute links only for directing users to a different website.-->
      <li>
        Absolute links, like to
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
          >Mozilla Developer Network</a
        >, which is a very good resource for web developers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Relative links, like our <a href="misc/extras.html">extras page</a>.
      </li>
      <!-- This won't work for our local HTML files -->
      <li>
        Root-relative links, like to the <a href="/">home page</a> of our
        website, but those aren't useful to us right now.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
